# [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/description/)


### Description

找出数组中的子数组，递增元素最多的子数组。
### Example:
 
    Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 

    Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
    Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 

### 方法一


### 自己Code

```java

class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0, anchor = 0;
        //[1,3,5,4,7]
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (i > 0 && nums[i-1] >= nums[i]) //如果前一个大于后一个，即不满足递增条件
            anchor = i;//i = 3；
            ans = Math.max(ans, i - anchor + 1);//ans = 3，都是递增，那么ans就加1，否则就清0
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

```
