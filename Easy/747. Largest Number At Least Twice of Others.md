# [747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others ](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/description/)


### Description
In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.

If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

### Example:
 
    Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
    6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.


    Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

### 方法一


### 自己Code

```java

class Solution {
    public int dominantIndex(int[] nums) {
        int maxIndex = 0;

        //    找出最大值所在的索引值，
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[maxIndex])
                maxIndex = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (maxIndex != i && nums[maxIndex] < 2 * nums[i])
                return -1;

            //如果i不等于最大值的索引值并且最大值小于i的两倍，那么说明数组中没有满足的元素，返回-1，

        }
        return maxIndex;
    }
}

```
