# [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/description/)


### Description

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.


### Example:
 

    Input:
    s = "abcd"
    t = "abcde"

    Output:
    e

    Explanation:
    'e' is the letter that was added.

    s = "abcd"
    t = "abcda"

    Output:
    a

    Explanation:
    'a' is the letter that was added.
### 方法一

### 自己Code
 a+b+c+d+a - (a+b+c+d)

```java
class Solution{
    public char findDifference(String s,String t){
        int charCode = t.charAt(s.length());

        for(int i = 0;i<s.length();++i){
            charCode -= (int)s.charAt(i);
            charCode += (int)t.charAt(i);
        }

        return (char)charCode;
    }
}
```
