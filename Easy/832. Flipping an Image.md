# [832. Flipping an Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/description/)


### Description

Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.


two steps!


To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].
### Example:
 
    Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
    Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
    Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
    Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]


    Input: [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
    Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
    Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
    Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
### 方法一
先对折再取反    
 //^异或操作符

    Operator    Name         Example     Result  Description
    a & b       and          3 & 5       1       1 if both bits are 1.
    a | b       or           3 | 5       7       1 if either bit is 1.
    a ^ b       xor          3 ^ 5       6       1 if both bits are different.
    ~a          not          ~3          -4      Inverts the bits.
    n << p      left shift   3 << 2      12      Shifts the bits of n left p positions. Zero bits are shifted into the low-order positions.
    n >> p      right shift  5 >> 2      1       Shifts the bits of n right p positions. If n is a 2's complement signed number, the sign bit is shifted into the high-order positions.
    n >>> p     right shift  -4 >>> 28   15      Shifts the bits of n right p positions. Zeros are shifted into the high-order positions.



    0 ^ 0 = 0
    1 ^ 1 = 0
    0 ^ 1 = 1
    1 ^ 0 = 1
### 自己Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] flipAndInvertImage(int[][] A) {
       
        int C = A[0].length;
        for (int[] row: A)
            for (int i = 0; i < (C + 1) / 2; ++i) {
                int tmp = row[i] ^ 1;//先取反
                row[i] = row[C - 1 - i] ^ 1;//对折，异或
                row[C - 1 - i] = tmp;
            }

        return A;
    }
}


```
