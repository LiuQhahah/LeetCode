# [830. Positions of Large Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/description/)


### Description

In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".

Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.
### Example:
 
    Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
    Output: [[3,6]]
    Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.

    Input: "abc"
    Output: []
    Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.

    Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
    Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
### 方法一


### 自己Code

```java

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> largeGroupPositions(String S) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList();
        int i = 0, N = S.length(); // i is the start of each group
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            if (j == N-1 || S.charAt(j) != S.charAt(j+1)) {
                // Here, [i, j] represents a group.
                if (j-i+1 >= 3)
                    ans.add(Arrays.asList(new Integer[]{i, j}));
                i = j + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}

```
